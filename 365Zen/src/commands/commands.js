  <br />
  Our application process is broken down to two main parts. Payment, and background information submission. &nbsp;You will need to get us both of those before we can move forward. Here&#39;s how..<br />
  <br />
  If you haven&#39;t submitted your application payment yet, you can do so with the link below:<br />
  <a href="https://movezen.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/acctmanagers/EZgzJDZR3LhMkdV820qNJs4BohN5zw1amoXeB2OuWVlikA?e=yL0V7q">Just to pay the $79 application&nbsp;fee.</a>&nbsp; This is the last step if you&nbsp;haven&#39;t paid, but have submitted your personal information</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>If you have paid, but haven&#39;t submitted your legal information for our background check,&nbsp;<a href="https://victoryre.appfolio.com/listings/">you can do that here</a><br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  We&#39;re excited to get started with finalizing! &nbsp;Please, it&#39;s very important that you review this&nbsp;introductory information to make sure we hit the ground running with aligned expectations.<br />
  <br />
  We&#39;ll often email or text important questions and info which is often sent to spam or promotion folders, so whitelist us or regularly check those folders<br />
  <br />
  Below you&#39;ll find a sample lease &amp; the rules of the road which you have hopefully already reviewed, if not you must do so as they will be included with your lease. &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  You&#39;ll also find crucial information on how to address pre-move in repairs and if you hope to get a pet during your time in the home. &nbsp;<br />

  <p>We have a much better solution using a payment process through your nearby WalMart or CVS!&nbsp; Among others</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>All you do is walk in with a barcode that we would provide to you by text or email, they scan it, you pay, and your rent is instantly&nbsp;funded and will&nbsp;show up on our end that way. It&#39;s the best way to avoid late fees</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>More importantly, it&#39;s a lot cheaper than buying multiple money orders</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>Finally it&#39;s low risk. With WalMart you know it&#39;s legitimate and safe. Just keep your receipt, and it&#39;s safer&nbsp;than a money order also</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>Contact us today and we&#39;ll send yours out!&nbsp; Customer Service Team</p>

  <p>We are starting the process of getting you set up to move in! &nbsp;From here we need the first month&#39;s rent (nonrefundable) hold payment made within 48 hours. &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  We&#39;ll collect your security deposit just prior to move in, or you can pay both now. &nbsp;In most cases only the first month&#39;s rent will be non-refundable should you not be able to move forward, so any additional payments are refundable, deposits, pet fees, etc. &nbsp;If we hold a home longer than 45 days the daily prorate hold charges will apply from day 46 on<br />
  <br />
  Your hold payment will ensure that no one else can get the property, a signed lease doesn&#39;t. &nbsp;You have to pay the full hold payment to fully secure the property. You&#39;ll receive a copy of your lease in just a bit, and it must be signed within 3 days or you risk losing the home. &nbsp;No home is completely secured until we have a signed agreement, and consideration (payment)<br />
  <br />
  From this point forward we&#39;ll send several very important emails and texts, so be sure to safelist us or keep an eye on your junk folder. &nbsp;Your tenant portal invite will arrive momentarily, and you are welcome to pay online via your portal IF your move-in is more than 7 days away from your payment date, otherwise, you must per company policy pay by certified check / money order delivered to our office or staff. &nbsp;There are never exceptions to that rule due to significant fraud risks. Please do not miss it. If you pay online, you would have to pay again in certified funds to move in within 7 days, and we&#39;d credit the uncleared funds to the next month<br />
  <br />
  <a href="https://movezen.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/Teams/Ed6cnS8o6Q5ChC7kduknd2oBhPoqj51MZdUXYuipKqtySQ?e=d5nokc">Consult the &quot;rules of the road&quot; if you have additional questions</a><br />
